# [Docs](./README.md) > Contributing to DataOps Docs

There are two main options for contributing to this repo: issues and pull requests.

## Issues

A GitHub **Issue** is a ticket you create that logs a specific problem, a bug, a feature request, or an inquiry. This issue will be logged centrally and responded to by the site maintainers.

> _**Issues are ideal when you see something which can be improved but there isn't an obvious fix.**_

## Pull Requests

A GitHub **Pull Request** ("PR") is a request for the site maintainers to _pull in_ changes that have been authored by other users.

> _**PRs are ideal when you already know how to improve the site and want to propose a set of specific changes.**_
