_These scripts leverage Homebrew, the package manager for Mac. [Click here](https://brew.sh) to learn more about Homebrew._

## QuickStart Overview

Starting out in DataOps requires a new set of tools from what developers may have used previously. Thankfully, package managers like Chocolatey and Homebrew exist to streamline the process of getting new software installed (and keeping it updated) on your machine.

The package manager reduces the time to get software installed, saving hours of time and ensuring everyone's machines are setup correctly with minimal effort. Here's a quick overview of the tools you'll install in the next section:

1. A **package manager**: Chocolatey (for Windows) or Homebrew (for Mac)
2. **Docker** - to run containerized apps and create your own.
3. **Git** - a version control platform used to store and manage code.
4. **GitHub Desktop** - a friendly GUI which works with Git and GitHub.com.
5. **Python** - a software language useful for developing new programs and scripts, and also used for its popular package manager `pip`, which allows users to install Python programs written by others.
6. **Terraform** - the leading cross-platform solution for automating Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
7. **VS Code** - a robust, fast, and lightweight development environment (IDE).

## Installing Homebrew and Core Tools

1. Open "Terminal".
2. Paste and run the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) install script:

   ```bash
   /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
   ```

3. Install git.

   ```cmd
   brew install git
   ```

4. Install core tools:

   ```cmd
   brew install cask docker python3 terraform
   brew cask install cakebrew visual-studio-code
   ```

## Installing additional tools

After following the instructions from the above, you should now have the **Cakebrew** app installed, which gives a friendly GUI on top of the Homebrew installer.

To install any additional programs, either open the **Cakebrew** app or copy-paste the below samples into a Terminal window. (You can also find additional packages at [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh).)

- `brew install awscli`
- `brew install azure-cli`
- `brew install elasticsearch`
- `brew install gradle`
- `brew cask install anaconda`
- `brew cask install dbeaver-community`
- `brew cask install github`
- `brew cask install google-chrome`
- `brew cask install microsoft-teams`
- `brew cask install pgadmin4`
- `brew cask install r`
- `brew cask install slack`
- `brew install aws-sam-cli` **You might first need to run: `brew tap aws/tap`
- `brew cask install selenium-server-standalone`
- `brew cask install firefox`
- `brew install jupyterlab`

## Extra Credit: Create a GitHub Account

For extra credit, visit [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and register a new account. Once you've created a GitHub account and installed the core software, you are all all set to contribute to open source projects in GitHub, including this one!

- _Tip: Rather than create multiple accounts, we recommend using a single GitHub account for both work and personal development projects._
